	    <h1> PREVENTION</h1>
		<p align="left">The best ways to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 are:</p>
		<div class=" PREVENTION">

          <ol>
			<li>Staying at least one metre away from people as much as possible, and even greater distance when you are indoors.</li>
			<li>Wearing a face mask when you are around others.</li>
			<li>There are two types of face masks, fabric masks (which you can make yourself and are suitable for most people) and medical masks.</li>
			<li>As medical masks are in short supply, they should only be worn by healthcare workers, people with COVID-19 symptoms and those caring for people with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. When it’s not possible to maintain a distance of one meter from others, people over 60 and those with underlying health conditions should also wear medical masks.</li>
			<li>Both fabric and medical-grade face masks are only effective when used correctly and alongside other prevention measures</li></ol>
			<p>There are several other measures you can take to prevent COVID-19 being passed on.</p>
			</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid places that are crowded, confined or involve close contact with others, especially indoors.</li>
			<li>Wash your hands regularly and properly using soap and water. You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser if you do not have access to water or soap.</li>
			<li>Get a COVID-19 vaccine when you are offered it.</li>
			<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
			<li>Keep indoor spaces well ventilated when you are inside with other people. You can do this by opening windows and doors to let fresh air in.</li>
			<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a clean tissue when you sneeze or cough. Throw the tissue away and wash your hands after. If you don’t have a tissue, cover your face with the inside of your elbow.</li>
			<li>Only meet people who are not part of your household outdoors, if local restrictions allow – outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones.</li>
			<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces regularly.</li>
		</ul>
