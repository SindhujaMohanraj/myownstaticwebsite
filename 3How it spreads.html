		<p align="left">This disease spreads in different ways:</p>
		<div class="spreading">
		  
          <ul>
          <li>COVID-19 is passed on through respiratory droplets. These are tiny droplets that come from your nose and mouth when you sneeze, cough, breathe, speak or sing.</li>
          <li>COVID-19 is normally passed on through close contact with someone who currently has the virus. When you are in close contact, you are likely to breathe in the respiratory droplets from their mouth and nose, which can contain the virus.</li>
          <li>Thereâ€™s a greater risk of getting COVID-19 in places where people are closer together and spend more time together. This includes indoor, crowded and poorly ventilated spaces, such as restaurants, gyms, nightclubs, offices and places of worship.</li>
          <li>Respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes can also land on surfaces. The virus is then spread when another person comes into contact with these droplets and touches their own eyes, nose or mouth, without washing their hands first.</li>
