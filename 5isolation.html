         <ol>
			<li>You will need to stay at home and self-isolate if you have symptoms of COVID-19 – even if they are mild. Call your local health authority for advice. Don’t visit the clinic, as you could pass the virus onto others.</li>
			<li>Do not leave your home for any reason during this time, including to go to work or school. Ask friends or neighbours to bring you any supplies you need. They should leave these outside and not enter your home. The people you live with should also stay home for at least 14 days from when you first noticed symptoms to prevent the virus from being passed on.</li>
			<li>If you have difficulty breathing, persistent pain in your chest or loss of speech or mobility, or confusion call your health provider immediately.</li>
			<li>Most people with COVID-19 recover from the virus without the need for hospital treatment.</li>
